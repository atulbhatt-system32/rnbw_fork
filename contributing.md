### pull requests

when reviewing a new PR, we prioritize testing the working functionality and then reviewing the code rather than the other way around.
shortly describe how you understand the issue and how you will resolve it. doing so helps ensure everyone is on the same page and can uncover mistakes.

in general, prs should:

- address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- include documentation in the repo or on our docs site.
- be tagged with the relevant corresponding issues.
- have a summary of your changes within the corresponding issues.

that's it! ðŸŽ‰
